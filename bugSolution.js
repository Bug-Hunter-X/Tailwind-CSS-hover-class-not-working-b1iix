```javascript
// Ensure that your CSS is correctly importing Tailwind directives.
/* ... your other CSS ... */
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

// Check for CSS Specificity
/*If you have other CSS that might override the Tailwind classes, you need to adjust the specificity*/

// Solution: Add !important (as a last resort) 
<div class="bg-red-500 hover:bg-blue-700 !important">
  Hover over me!
